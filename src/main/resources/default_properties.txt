# ALARM DATA
# ----------
#
# To deactivate the alarm, change to false
alarmActivityState = true

# RepeatSettings are in the form of:
# alarmSettingsNUMBER = day;state;hours;min;seconds;eventToActivate1;eventToActivate2;eventToActivate3
# where state is the repeat state (so true for repeat, false for only 1)
# What events can be activated are found in the PopularProperties.properties file in Izou. In order to add an event,
# just add the eventID (key) as the eventToActivate. If nothing is added, "IZOU_ALARM" (or izou.alarm) will be added
# automatically. If your event ID is not found, the default event ID is also added.
# You can add as many eventIDs as you want.
# alarmSettings MUST be in the name of your alarm settings, else your alarm settings will not be found.
# EXAMPLE: alarmSettings1 = monday;true;15;30;00;intellimate_izou_addon_izouclock
#          alarmSettings2 = tuesday;false;8;30;00

# Enter the ID of the audio player that should be used to play the sound - the default is set to:
# org.intellimate.izou.addon.izousound.outputplugin.AudioFilePlayer
audioPlayerID = org.intellimate.izou.addon.izousound.outputplugin.AudioFilePlayer

# RINGTONE DATA
# -------------
#
# If a ringtone exists and should be played, change to true
ringtoneActivityState = false

# Enter the name of the audio file that is to be used as a ringtone (it has to be in the wav or mp3 format)
audioFileName = null

# The place in the audio file where to start the ringtone-playback (in milliseconds)
startPointAudioFile = 0

# The place in the audio file where to end the ringtone-playback (in milliseconds)
durationAudioFile = 0

#
# -------------
# PRESENCE DATA
# -------------
#
# Set the number of times the sound should be played if not present
soundPlayCounter = 10

# Below are a few options to have the alarm interact with the presence interface in Izou. However make sure that
# one option is set to true and the other option is set to false, or that both are set to false. If both options
# are set to true, the first one (fireUntilPresent) will be chosen and the second one (fireUntilAbsent) will be ignored.
#
# If the alarm event should be fired until the user is present, set fireUntilPresent to true
fireUntilPresent = false

# If the alarm event should be fired until the user is absent, set fireUntilAbsent to
# true.
fireUntilAbsent = false

#
# -------------
# TTS DATA
# -------------
#
# Below is the syntax for greetings for the alarm in the form of:
# language_sentenceType_ID_(optional)randomizeId's
#
# Randomized ID means that among all gretings with the same name yet different randomized IDs, one is chosen at
# random.
#
# Language is the language de, the sentenceType should usually always be p (phrase)
# you can use the following variables:
#   $hour24 = hour of the day in 24-hour system
#   $hour12 = hour of the day in 12-hour system
#   $min    = minute of the day
#   $state  = AM or PM
# They have to be on their own, meaning no characters but spaces
# should come before or after them. Correct spelling is imperative!
